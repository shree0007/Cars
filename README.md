# Project Cars

This project is an assignment for the course JS. 


## DISCRIPTION:

Step 1: 

-Ask for the carâ€™s licence plate, car maker, car model, current owner, price and color.<br>
-Get the user input and create a new car object based on those properties. Show the data as a table on a webpage.<br>


Step 2: 

-Create a function that allows the user to search for a specific car based on a license plate.<br>
-When the licence plate is found, show the car mark, model and owner on the screen. <br>


Step 3: 

-Create a method discount() for the car object that returns a discounted price. The discounted price depends on the price of the car. If the price is over 20 000, the discount is 25%. If it is under 5000, it is 10%. Otherwise, the discount is 15%.<br>
-Display the discount % and the discount amount in the search
